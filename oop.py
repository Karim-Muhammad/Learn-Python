# OOP you must apply in Projects to understands
# OOP maybe works as hoisting, if you define function below
# and you can call it above!


# Object Oriented Three Pillars
# 1- Encapsulation (use "self")
# 2- Inheritance (no duplicate)
# 3- Polymorphism (similar action in different object)


# Lesson 2

# Everything in Python is Object of Particular Type
# Object is a unit of data, has one, or more attributes

print(type(10)); # <class 'int'>
# What is meaning of "class int"?

# every datatype you define, it instance of its class

# type(10) -> <class 'int'>
# type(10.9) -> <class 'float'>
# type("10.9k") -> <class 'str'>
# type("karim") -> <class 'str'>
# type("l") -> <class 'str'>
# type(True) -> <class 'bool'>
# type([]) -> <class 'list'>
# type(()) -> <class 'tuple'>
# type(set()) -> <class 'set'>
# type({}) -> <class 'dict'>
# type( def fun(): pass ) -> <class 'function'>
# type(None) -> <class 'NoneType'>
# type( type(None) ) -> <class 'type'>


# They Classifying These Data, and each one has his attributes, and methods


num = 1;
